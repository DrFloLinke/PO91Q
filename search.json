    "text": "Welcome!\nWelcome to “Fundamentals in Quantitative Research Methods”. This module has two main aims: to provide an introduction to secondary data acquisition, management and analysis in the social sciences; prepare you to acquire further statistical training and make use of statistics in future research projects. The module does not require any prior knowledge of mathematics or statistics. You only need to understand the importance of statistics for empirical social sciences, and show willingness to learn about them.\nThis is the online companion to the seminars on PO91Q. It hosts all of the material needed for the seminars and replaces any physical worksheets. This is environmentally friendlier, and has the great advantage that when working with R, it allows you to copy/paste code directly from the code chunks in this online companion.\nWelcome on board!\n\n \n\n\n\nCompanion Features\nYou will find embedded in the text six different types of boxes which serve different purposes:\n\nThis box appears whenever I want you to stop at a particular point in the worksheet and to flag up to me that you are done.\n\n\nThis appears when you need to be careful with your coding in R to avoid problems.\n\n\nSome explanations that will hopefully make your work with this webpage or learning the material itself easier.\n\n\nWe will start working with R in week 5, and I have recorded some videos to ease you into working with the program.\n\n\nA brief question which tests your understanding of the previous material.\n\n\nA definition that is important for the current discussion.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe companion uses the font “Lexend”. Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.\nCode is displayed in Recursive Mono. The font’s characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.\nEquations and mathematical expressions are set in Fira Math. Fira Math is easy to read with open shapes, clear spacing, and good contrast. This keeps subscripts, superscripts, and fractions legible - even at small sizes. It stays readable on screens and in print, reducing mix-ups between look-alike characters like 1, I, and l.\nIf the three-column layout feels too busy, click the small text icon in the companion’s top-right to switch to Reader Mode. This streamlines the page and minimises the table of contents into a compact bar at the top.\nThe companion also uses a dark mode theme. For many users, including some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode can reduce eye strain and enhance focus by minimising visual overstimulation.\nWhilst I recognise that mobile phones play an essential part in all our daily lives, please note that this companion is optimised for display on tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.",

    "text": "R - Getting Started\nIn this worksheet and also in all other presentations and documents I use on this module, I am using two different fonts:\n\nFont for plain text\nA typewriter font for R functions, values, etc.\n\nI am also regularly including “screenshots” of operations in R with their output. Whenever you see these, please replicate them on your own computer. To start, let’s have a look at RStudio itself. When you open the programme, you are presented with the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: RStudio\n\n\n\nIt has – for now – three components to it. On the left hand-side you see the so-called Console into which you can enter the commands, and in which also most of the results will be displayed. On the right hands side, you see the Workspace which consists of an upper and a lower window. The upper window has three tabs in it. The tab Environment will provide you with a list of all the data sets you have loaded into R, and also of the objects and values you create (more on that later). Under the History tab, you find a history (I know, who would have thought it) of all the commands you have used. This can be very useful to retrace your steps. In the Connections tab you can connect to online sources. We will not use this tab.\nIn the lower window, you have five tabs. Under Files you find the file structure of your computer. Once you have set a working directory (more on that in a moment), you can also view the files in your working directory here which gives you a good overview of the files you need to refer to for a particular project. The Plots tab will display the graphs we will be producing. Packages form the heart and soul of R and they make the program as powerful as it is (again, more on that later). RStudio also has a Help function, which is rarely very illuminating. I usually search for stuff online on “stackexchange”, as there is a large community of R users out there who share their knowledge and solutions to problems. We won’t use the last tab Viewer.\n\nIntroduction to R Studio\nIf you can’t get enough of my delightful German accent, then I have some videos for you in which I go through the respective components of the worksheet on screen.

    "section": "RScript",
    "text": "RScript\nIf you read the previous section carefully, you will have noticed that I wrote that you can enter the commands” in the Console. You can, but you shouldn’t. What you should be using instead is an RScript. An RScript is a list of commands you use for a project (an essay, your dissertation, an article) to calculate quantities of interest, such as descriptive statistics in the form of mean, median and mode, and produce graphs.\nOne of the foundations of scientific research is “reproducibility”, or “replicability”. This means that “sufficient information exists with which to understand, evaluate, and build upon a prior work if a third party could replicate the results without any additional information from the author.” (King, 1995, p. 444, emphasis removed) This principle applies in academia more generally, because only if you understand what a person has done before you, you can pick their work up whether they left it, and push the boundaries of knowledge further. But a bit closer to home, it is also relevant for conducting quantitative research in assessments. We require you to submit an RScript (or a “do file” if you use Stata) now together with your actual essay. This is not only to check what you have done; data preparation is often the most time-consuming part (as you will soon discover), and this is a way to gain recognition for this work. So it is actually to your advantage, and not a mere plagiarism check.\nThe creation of an RScript will allow you to open the raw data, and by running the script, to bring it to exactly where you left off. This saves you saving data sets which can take up a lot of work. If you back the script up properly, you also have an insurance against losing all your work a day before the assessment is due.\nTo create an RScript, click File \\(\\rightarrow\\) New File \\(\\rightarrow\\) RScript. A fourth window opens, and your screen will now look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The RScript Window\n\n\n\nYou can now write your commands in the RScript, where a new line (for now) means a new command. If you want to execute a command, put the cursor on the line the command is on and press “command” / “enter” simultaneoulsy on a Mac and “Ctrl” / “Enter” on Windows.\nIf you precede a line with #, you can write annotations to yourself, for example explaining what you do with a particular command. More on this in the next sub-section.\nFigure 3 shows the start of the RScript for this worksheet. I prefer a dark background, it’s easier on the eyes, especially when you work with R for long periods. You can change the settings in: Tools \\(\\rightarrow\\) Global Options \\(\\rightarrow\\) Appearance \\(\\rightarrow\\) Twilight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of an RScript\n\n\n\n\nMore Themes\nIf you copy and paste the following code chunks into your “Console” and run one at a time, you will have even more themes1 to choose from:\n\ninstall.packages(\n  \"rsthemes\",\n  repos = c(gadenbuie = 'https://gadenbuie.r-universe.dev', getOption(\"repos\"))\n)\n\nrsthemes::install_rsthemes()\n\nYou can also download Flo’s Dark Theme2 and then “add” it at the bottom of the “Appearance” menu.\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\n\nRScript Structure\nWell, I am German, and I like things neat and tidy, so I feel almost compelled to discuss how to properly organise an RScript. But apart from genetical dispositions, a well-organised RScript is also very much in the spirit of reproducibility. It simply makes sense to structure an RScript in such a way that another researcher is able to easily read and understand it.\nFirst of all, which commands to include? If you introduce me to your current girlfriend or boyfriend, I have no interest in learning about all your past relationships; they have not worked out. In a similar fashion, nobody wants to read through lines of code that are irrelvant. So you will only include in the RScript those commands which produce the output you actually include in the essay or article.\nI stated above that if you precede a line with #, you can write annotations to yourself. This is also a useful way to structure an RScript, for example into exercise numbers, sections of an essay /article, or different stages of data preparation (which we will be doing in due course).\n\nRScript Structure",

    "text": "First Steps in R\nBut enough of the preliminary talk, let’s get started in R. In principle, you can think of R as a massive and powerful calculator. So I will use it as such to start of with. If you want to know what the sum of 5 and 3 is, you type (in the RScript, not the Console):\n\n5+3\n\nand press “command” / “enter” (or “Ctrl” / “enter” if you are on Windows). In everything that is to follow, commands will be shown in their own individual boxes. These have a clipboard button on the right, so you can copy and paste the code into your own RScript. The output is presented in a separate box directly underneath. There is no clipboard button, as R will render this result in your own console when you run the code. So, including the result, the calculation would look like this:\n\n5+3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nwhere the [1] indicates that the 8 is the first component of the result. In this case, we only have one component, so it’s superfluous really, but we will soon encounter situations in which results can have a number of different items.\n\nYou can copy the code from this page by clicking the clipboard icon in the top-right hand corner. You can then paste it into your RScript.\n\nA fundamental component of R is objects. You can define an object by way of a reversed arrow, and you can assign values, characters, or functions to them. If we want to assign the sum of 5 and 3 to an object called result, for example, we call3\n\nresult &lt;- 5+3\n\nIf we now call the object, R will return its value, 8.\n\nresult\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nMake a habit of adding a note underneath each code chunk in your RScript (preceded with a #) in which you translate the code into plain English. This is especially useful for the lengthy complex chunks.",

At the very least you should have a folder called “University” or similar, in which you have a sub-folder for each module you take.\nIn those modules in which you are working with R, you need to extend this system a little. I have created a schematic of what I have in mind in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Folder Structure\n\n\n\nYou see that there is a sub-folder for each week of the module, and that each of these folders is divided into lecture and seminar in turn. Into these you can place the lecture and seminar materials, respectively. Create this system now for PO11Q.\nR works with so-called Working Directories. You can think of these as drawers from which R takes everything it needs to conduct the analysis (such as the data set), and into which it puts everything it produces (such as graph plots). As this will be an R-specific drawer within the seminar, create yet another sub-folder in your seminar folder, and call it something suitable, such as “PO11Q_Seminar_Week 1”. Do NOT call this “Working Directory”, as you will have many of those, rendering this name completely meaningless. Save the file EU.xlsx into this folder. Data are taken from European Comission (n.d.).\n\nPlease set up this structure now. If I find you using a random folder on your desktop named “working directory” in the coming weeks, I am going to implode! I mean it.\n\nNow we need to tell R to use this folder. If you know the file structure of your computer you can simply use the setwd() command, and enter the path. Here is an example from my computer:\n\nsetwd(\"~/Warwick/Modules/PO91Q/Seminars/Week 1/R Week 1\")\n\nIf you don’t know the file structure of your computer, then you can click Session \\(\\rightarrow\\) Set Working Directory \\(\\rightarrow\\) Choose Directory.\n\nWorking Directory",

The first package we need to use will enable us to load an Excel sheet into R. It is called readxl. You can install any package with the command install.packages() where the package name goes, wrapped in quotation marks, into the brackets:\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\n\nWe can then load this package into our library with the library() command.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n\nOnce you close R at the end of a session, the library will be reset.

It is the str() command, where “str” stands for structure:\n\nstr(EU)\n\ntibble [28 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ country : chr [1:28] \"Belgium\" \"Bulgaria\" \"Czechia\" \"Denmark\" ...\n $ pop18   : num [1:28] 11413058 7050034 10610055 5781190 82850000 ...\n $ access  : num [1:28] 1951 2007 2004 1973 1951 ...\n $ area    : num [1:28] 30280 108560 77230 42430 348540 ...\n $ GDP_2015: num [1:28] 4.66e+11 1.22e+11 3.19e+11 2.46e+11 3.60e+12 ...\n\n\nYou can see that R has recognised most variables as numerical, one is displayed as a character variable. This is appropriate for some variables, such as pop18, but not for the ordinal variable access which is ordinal. We need to recode it, and all other variables we are unhappy with.",

    "section": "Variable Types in R",
    "text": "Variable Types in R\nR distinguishes between a number of different variable types and here is a broad overview of them. This will help you in deciding which descriptive statistics to calculate, or into which variable type you need to recode (next step) to achieve what you want. There are two general types:\n\nnumeric – numbers\ncharacter (also called string) – letters\n\nWithin numeric we can distinguish between the following:\n\nfactor - nominal\nordered factor - ordinal\ninteger - numeric, but only “whole” numbers (discrete)\nnumeric - any number (interval or ratio)\n\nNumerical variables are already in the data set, we have to attend to nominal and ordinal variables.\n\nNominal Variables\nIn terms of the variable types we encountered in the lecture this week, the country name is a nominal variable. So we need to tell R to turn this into a factor variable. We do this as follows:\n\nEU$country = factor(EU$country)\n\n\n\nOrdinal Variables\nAs mentioned above, the variable access should be ordinal, and therefore has to be turned into an ordered factor. The command which follows is almost identical to producing a factor variable, only that we add the option ordered = TRUE at the end:\n\nEU$access_fac = factor(EU$access, ordered = TRUE)\n\nIf you are familiar with European Studies, you will know that each accession wave has got a particular name. The 1973 enlargement, for example, is called the “First Enlargement”, the 1981 wave the Mediterranean Enlargement, and so forth. Let us create a new variable which uses these names instead of the years.\nThis process is a little more involved, and requires a new package to be installed and loaded: dplyr. This package is part of the so-called tidyverse which is a suite of packages designed to make working with R simpler and commands shorter. You can install all of them by calling install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). We then load the tidyverse with:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nThe command which follows takes a little explaining. We start by stating the dataframe we wish to assign the result to, EU. Then we name the data frame that contains the data we wish to manipulate, here also EU. The symbol which follows, \\%&gt;\\%, reads as “and then”, and is called a “pipe”. So we take the data frame EU “and then” carry out a function called mutate. It creates a new variable called wave by recoding (recode_factor) the variable access_fac. The command then specifies all categories of the “old” variable access_fac and what their respective values in the “new” variable wave are going to be. The categories in each are set in quotation marks, as they are factor / character categories.\n\nEU &lt;- EU %&gt;%\n  mutate(wave = recode_factor(access_fac, '1951'=\"Founding\", \n                       '1973'= \"First\",\n                       '1981'= \"Mediterranean\",\n                       '1986' = \"Mediterranean\",\n                       '1995' = \"Cold War\",\n                       '2004' = \"Eastern\",\n                       '2007' = \"Eastern\",\n                       '2013' = \"Balkans\"))\n\nPlease note that some colleagues in the department object to the use of the tidyverse as a “dialect” of R, and require you to use base R in their modules. However, on this module I am still using the tidyverse, as:\n\nmy textbook, which is going to be the main textbook for this module from 2026, uses the tidyverse, and I think it is pedagogically wrong to divert from the main text in my seminars\nI do not think it makes sense to exclude one of currently 23,029 packages2\nGGPLOT2 which is part of the tidyverse simplifies code for generating figures significantly and will do for all but the most specific requirements\na lot of support on stackexchange is geared toward the tidyverse as a lot of US-based data scientists work with this package, and so you will find it easier to solve problems\n\nBut to keep everybody happy, I am providing the base R code whenever possible in a collapsible section like this one:\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\nEU$wave &lt;- NA\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='1951'] &lt;- \"Founding\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='1973'] &lt;- \"First\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='1981'] &lt;- \"Mediterranean\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='1986'] &lt;- \"Mediterranean\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='1995'] &lt;- \"Cold War\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='2004'] &lt;- \"Eastern\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='2007'] &lt;- \"Eastern\"\nEU$wave[EU$access_fac=='2013'] &lt;- \"Balkans\"\n\nEU$wave &lt;- factor(EU$wave, ordered = TRUE)\n\nHere, we first create a new, empty variable called wave in the EU data set. We then create new values , for example Founding in the variable EU$wave for the condition (this is what the square brackets [ ] do) that the variable access_fac in the EU data set, equals a specific value. For Founding this is is 1951. The last step is to turn the wave variable into an ordered factor.\n\n\nBut back to the recoding exercise itself. Please note that the original variable access_fac was already an ordered factor. Therefore, R (or the mutate function to be precise) also returns wave as an ordered factor. Had access_fac been an unordered factor (aka nominal variable), wave would also have been an unorderd factor. You can specify in an option (.ordered - don’t miss out the dot) of the recode_factor function whether you want the factor to be ordered or not:\n\nEU &lt;- EU %&gt;%\n  mutate(wave = recode_factor(access_fac, '1951'=\"Founding\", \n                       '1973'= \"First\",\n                       '1981'= \"Mediterranean\",\n                       '1986' = \"Mediterranean\",\n                       '1995' = \"Cold War\",\n                       '2004' = \"Eastern\",\n                       '2007' = \"Eastern\",\n                       '2013' = \"Balkans\", .ordered=TRUE))\n\naccess only had a handful of numbers, and it turned out that each numerical value of this variable turned into a category in the new one. But often you have to recode variables of a more continuous nature into categories. Suppose, for example, we have the variable age which contains the age of respondents in a survey. If we wanted to recode this into categories such as 20-25, 26-35, etc., it would be tedious to assign a category to each individual value of age. This is where the cut() function comes in handy, as it literally cuts up a variable into chunks at the points we specify. Let’s apply this to the access variable.\nAgain, we use the mutate function, this time naming our new variable wave1 (so as not to overwrite the wave variable we created with the recode() function). The cut() function splits a numeric variable into intervals using the breaks we specify in the function. Importantly, these intervals are left-open and right-closed. This means that each interval includes its upper boundary, but not the lower one. This sounds complicated, so let me give you an example. If, for example, we called\n\ncut(x, breaks = c(10, 20, 30))\n\nthen the first interval would start at 10 and include all values greater than 10 and up to and including 20. The next interval would contain all values that are larger than 20 and up to and including 30.\nWhen we apply this to our access variable, we therefore need to specify the breaks as follows:\n\ncut(access, breaks=c(1950, 1951, 1973, 1986, 1995, 2007, 2013))\n\nThe first category (Founding) thus contains all years up to and including 1951, the next category (First), all years larger than 1951 and up to and including 1973, and so forth. Having created these categories (or levels in R terminology), we can then label them accordingly with labels.\n\nEU &lt;- EU %&gt;% \n  mutate(wave1=cut(access, \n                  breaks=c(1950, 1951, 1973, 1986, 1995, 2007, 2013), \n                  labels=c(\"Founding\",\"First\",\n                           \"Mediterranean\", \n                           \"Cold War\", \n                           \"Eastern\", \n                           \"Balkans\"))) \n\n\nlevels(EU$wave)\n\n[1] \"Founding\"      \"First\"         \"Mediterranean\" \"Cold War\"     \n[5] \"Eastern\"       \"Balkans\"      \n\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\nEU$wave &lt;- cut(EU$access, \n                  breaks=c(1950, 1951, 1973, 1986, 1995, 2007, 2013), \n                  labels=c(\"Founding\",\"First\",\n                           \"Mediterranean\", \n                           \"Cold War\", \n                           \"Eastern\", \n                           \"Balkans\"))\n\n\n\n\nRecoding a Factor Variable\n\n\n\n\nRecoding Ordered Factor Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary Dummy\nVery often in political science we have yes/no scenarios, such as democracy yes or no, civil war, yes or no, etc. To analyse these scenarios, we can create so-called “dummy variables”. In the present example, let’s specify for each country whether it has been a founding member of the EU. It is a factor variable and so we do could do this exactly the same way as our initial recoding of the wave variable above:\n\nEU &lt;- EU %&gt;%\n  mutate(founding = recode(access_fac, '1951'=\"Yes\", \n                       '1973' = \"No\",\n                       '1981' = \"No\",\n                       '1986' = \"No\",\n                       '1995' = \"No\",\n                       '2004' = \"No\",\n                       '2007' = \"No\",\n                       '2013' = \"No\"))\n\nThere is a much shorter way to do this, however, and shorter is always preferred in coding so long as it leads to the same result. We can apply the ifelse() function which follows the rationale: ifelse('condition', 'if condition met, then', 'otherwise'). Here, if access_fac==\"1951\" we want to assign the value \"Yes\", if not \"No\":\n\nEU &lt;- EU %&gt;% \n   mutate(founding = factor(ifelse(access_fac==\"1951\", \"Yes\", \"No\"), \n                              levels =c(\"Yes\", \"No\")))\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\nUsing ifelse, this is very similar, only the pipe disappears:\n\nEU$founding &lt;- factor(ifelse(EU$access_fac==\"1951\", \"Yes\", \"No\"), \n                              levels =c(\"Yes\", \"No\"))",

    "text": "Sub-Setting Data\nWhen we start analysing data, we rarely need all data at the same time. We might not need some variables, at all, for example, or we only want to work with certain observations, such as those countries in the “founding” wave. In these cases, we can subset the data. I will show you some examples of subsetting now.\n\nBy Variable\nIf you are sure you won’t need a variable (remember, there is no back button), you can simply drop (i.e. delete) it. Let’s do this with the area variable:\n\nEU$area &lt;- NULL\n\nIf we are dropping multiple variables, we can either perform this operation each time, or use another command which allows us to operate with multiple variables at the same time. The select() command comes from the tidyverse package and specifies which variables we wish to keep:\n\nEU_pop &lt;- select(EU, country, pop18, access_fac, founding)\n\nThis creates a new data frame called EU_pop containing only the variables country, pop18, access_fac, and founding.\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\nThe package documentation offers some basic instructions how to convert the tidyverse (or dyplyr, to be precise) code into base R. But here is the solution for the previous code chunk:\n\nEU_pop &lt;- subset(EU, country, pop18, access_fac, founding)\n\n\n\nWe can, however, use the same command and tell R which variables to drop by adding a minus sign in from of the variables we want to delete. The following command produces exactly the same result as the one before:\n\nEU_pop1 &lt;- select(EU, -access, -GDP_2015)\n\n\n\nBy Observation\nInstead of dropping and keeping variables, we can do the same thing to individual observations. Here, we use the slice() command (like a cake) and specify which slices we want to drop or keep. For example to drop the Benelux countries we would delete observations 1, 16 and 19:\n\nEU_nobenelux &lt;- slice(EU, -1, -16, -19)\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\nEU_pop &lt;- EU[c(-1, -16, -19),]\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if we were only interested in Benelux countries we would subset to only those observations:\n\nEU_benelux &lt;- slice(EU, 1, 16, 19)\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\nEU_pop &lt;- EU[c(1, 16, 19),]\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep if a variable has a certain value\nOne of the most useful commands is filter(), as it allows us to keep all observations for which the value of a variable is of a particular number. For example if we wanted to conduct an analysis with all countries which have a population in excess of 10 million we could subset by:\n\nEU_pop_large &lt;- filter(EU, pop18 &gt; 10000000)\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\nEU_pop_large &lt;- subset(EU, pop18 &gt; 10000000)\n\n\n\nHere is a list of some operators you can use for this purpose:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nexactly equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n!x\nNot x\n\n\nx | y\nx OR y\n\n\nx & y\nx AND y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Operators in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSubsetting Data",

The range of the pop18 variable is about 82 million - this is rather unwieldy to imagine and also to put onto axes of graphs, as they would mostly consist of zeros. So let’s express the population of each countries in million instead:\n\nEU$popmio &lt;- EU$pop18/1000000\n\nWe can now produce a histogram. Before doing this, it is sensible to think about the number of bars we want in the histogram. The smallest country has just shy of 500,000 inhabitants, whereas the largest has over 82 million. So, I would like the x-axis to run from zero to 100 (million) and divide this into 5 bars. Accordingly, we are introducing 4 breaks on the x-axis with the following command:\n\nhist(EU$popmio, breaks = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is certainly a histogram, but it does not conform to the principle of graphs that they should be able to communicate their message independently, yet. Take the label of the x-axis, for example, what does EU$popmio mean? You and I know, but somebody who doesn’t know R language wouldn’t. We can tell R to adjust the axis label, as well as the main title of the histogram as follows:\n\nhist(EU$popmio, breaks = 4,\n     xlab = \"Population in million\",\n     main = \"Histogram of EU Population (2018)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Histogram of EU Population (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\n\n\nThis is fine now.

    "section": "Advanced Graphs",
    "text": "Advanced Graphs\nThe graphs we have produced so far are functional, but let’s be honest, they wouldn’t win any beauty contests. There is, as mentioned earlier, an amazing package called ggplot2 which changes this dramatically. You have already installed it as a part of the tidyverse. Otherwise, the function would be:\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nWe can just load it:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nThe “gg” in ggplot2 stands for “grammar of graphs”. You will be familiar with the term “grammar”” from learning a language already. In this context, we use grammar to build sentences by choosing and arranging a variety different components, such as subjects, verbs and objects. If you know how to do this properly, you can express exactly what you want to say. The grammar of graphs adopts this logic and specifies a number of different components which allow you to create a graph which is able to communicate exactly what you wish to show.\nggplot2 has eight basic grammatical arguments:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Frame\nThe data you wish to visualize.\n\n\nAesthetic Mappings\nHere you specify how the data are assigned to colour, size, etc. For now, this is the variable for which we want to create a graphical distribution.\n\n\nGeom\nShort for \"geometry\". Use a geom function to represent data points through geometric objects, such as points, lines, etc. Each function returns a layer.\n\n\nStat\nYou can include statistical summaries through this, such as smoothing, or regression lines.\n\n\nPosition\nPosition adjustments determine how to arrange geoms that would otherwise occupy the same space.\n\n\nFacets\nFacets divide a plot into sub-plots based on the values of one or more discrete variables.\n\n\nScale\nMaps data values to the visual values of an aesthetic. For example female=pink, male=blue.\n\n\nCoordinates\nHow do the numbers get translated onto the plot? We are not going to look at this on this module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nI like to think of using these arguments like dressing myself in the morning. The minimum that common decency requires me to wear if I wish to leave the house is some underwear, some trousers, and a top. Depending on how I feel and what the weather is like, I can add more layers, like socks, a jumper, or a scarf. It is exactly the same with ggplot2. As a minimum to produce a plot you need a data frame, the aesthetic mapping and a geom. Once you have produced this minimalistic graph, you can modify it, by adding more components / arguments. As you can imagine the possibilities are almost endless, and we only have time to deal with the minimum here. This is not a problem, however, as most of the other grammatical arguments (Stats, Position, Facets and Scales) generally have sensible defaults.\nSo how does this work in practice? Let us reproduce the histogram of the age variable. We start by calling ggplot2 and advise the function which data frame we wish to use (EU). In a second step, we add a geometry – in our case geom_histogram. Within the geometry, we need to specify for which variable we wish to create a distribution, or in the language of ggplot2 which variable we wish to map to the geom as our Aesthetic. To produce 5 bars again, we specify a bandwidth of 20 million (this refers to popmio).\n\nggplot(data = EU) +\n  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(popmio), binwidth = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Histogram of EU Population (binwidth = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnoyingly, ggplot places the axis ticks in the middle of each bar which is WRONG for histograms. They need to align with the boundaries of the bars. We do this by telling R the boundary of the plot:\n\nggplot(data = EU) +\n  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(popmio), binwidth = 20, \n                 boundary = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histogram of EU Population (binwidth = 20, boundary = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has shifted the ticks to the left, but now R has decided to label the x-axis in steps of 25, whereas our bars have a bandwidth of 20. Once again, we have the variable name on the x-axis, instead of a label which anybody could understand. I also prefer “Frequency” on the y-axis, instead of “Count”. To address both of these concerns, we simply add a layer for each. First up are the axis ticks. Our variable is continuous, so we choose the scale_x_continuous option, and tell R to break the axis up into a sequence which starts with zero, ends at 100 and has steps of 20 in between. In the labs argument we adjust the labelling as intended:\n\nggplot(data=EU) +\n  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(popmio), binwidth = 20, \n                 boundary = 0) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 20)) +\n  labs(x=\"Population (in million)\", y=\"Frequency\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\nhist(EU$popmio, breaks = 4,\n     xlab = \"Population (in million)\", ylab = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Histogram of EU Population with GGPLOT\n\n\n\nI have also removed the background in line with the principles set out by Tufte (2001, p. 96) by adding theme_classic(). This is it. A graph which can communicate its message independently, and which looks aesthetically pleasing.\nIn the present case we have the population, so displaying the frequency on the y-axis is sort of sensible, but usually we would be dealing with a sample. Here the count is not very telling and we would be using percentages, instead. Let’s do it!",

    "text": "Even More Advanced Graphs\nUnfortunately, there is no easy, default way to do this in R, but necessitates a calculation within the ggplot command. Once more we call ggplot and use the EU data set, and select the geom geom_histogram. Again we specify the binwidth as 20 with a boundary of zero, and put popmio on the x-axis. Now comes the point where we need to do something new, because y is not equivalent to the frequency any more, but should be percentage. To achieve this we advise R to put the density there (which is the relative frequency from the the lecture in week 5), and multiply this density by 100 to get percentage. Nothing has changed on the scaling of the x-axis from the previous plot, so we can copy and paste the scale_x_continuous section, as well as the labelling of the x-axis. In this last step, we now also need to adjust the label of the y-axis, because this has now percentage on it, and not frequency. The result is this:\n\nggplot(data = EU) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, boundary = 0,\n                 aes(x= popmio, \n                     y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)*100)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 20)) +\n  labs(x=\"Population (in million)\", y=\"percent\")  +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nBase R Solution\n\n\n# Create histogram data without plotting\nh &lt;- hist(EU$popmio, \n         breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20), \n         plot = FALSE)\n\n# Normalize counts to percentages\nh$counts &lt;- h$counts / sum(h$counts) * 100\n\n# Plot histogram\nplot(h, \n    freq = FALSE, \n    xlab = \"Population (in million)\", \n    ylab = \"percent\", \n    main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram of EU Population with GGPLOT in Percent\n\n\n\n\nJazzy Graphs with GGPLOT",

    "title": "Week 3",
    "section": "How to read a z-table",
    "text": "How to read a z-table\nIn the lecture you have learned about the Normal Distribution. Under the Normal Distribution, the area under the curve is determined by the number of standard deviations around our mean \\(\\mu\\). This number is expressed in the form of the z-score which is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nz=\\frac{\\text{Observation} - \\text{Mean}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}}=\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTo put this in words, z takes the difference between a particular value we are interested in and the mean. It then divides this distance by the standard deviation, in order to express the distance in units of standard deviations. Why do we do this? We know that under the Normal Distribution the area of the interval mean \\(\\pm\\) one standard deviation is equal to 68%. This is equivalent to the blue area in Figure 1. This also means that the remaining white area is equal to 32%, or the white section on each side 16%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Area under the Normal Distribution\n\n\n\nImagine now, we took the point of minus one standard deviation as a starting point, and turn right, as in Figure 2. The white area is still 16%, so that the blue area needs to be 84%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Right-Tail Probability\n\n\n\nSo the probability of finding a value larger than what is equivalent to minus one standard deviation is 84%. We call this a right-tail probability. The beauty is that we can do this for any point on the x-axis. Once we know how many standard deviations a value is removed from the mean, we can use the right-tail probability to assess how likely a value higher (or lower) than this value is to occur.\nThe number of standard deviations is the z-score. Every z-score has a right-tail probability associated with it. These probabilities are listed in the Normal Table. How do we read this Table? Let me take you through the example used in the lecture once more. The crime rate in our 32 Scottish councils is normally distributed, with \\(\\mu=280.36\\) and \\(\\sigma=69.26\\). You can see this distribution visualised in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of Crime Rate in 32 Scotting Councils, 2020\n\n\n\nThe question then was how likely it was for us to find a council with a crime rate larger than 400. If we wanted to visualise this, we would need the area to the right of 400 on the x-axis. This would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Probability of a Council with a Crime Rate \\(\\geq\\) 400\n\n\n\nIn order to calculate the size of this area, we first took the difference between 400 and 280.36 which is 119.64. We then divided 119.64 by the standard deviation of 69.26, to express the distance in units of the standard deviation. The result is 1.727404. We know, therefore, that a crime rate of 400 on the x-axis is located 1.727404 standard deviations to the right of the mean.\nWe now need to find the right-tail probability that belongs to this value. In the left-most column of the Normal Table you find the z-values with the first decimal place. Move down to 1.7. From here you turn right, until you hit the second decimal place. As our value is 1.73 you will have to go four columns to the right (the first one is for decimal 0). For a z-score of 1.73 the area is 0.0418, or 4.2%. We can therefore say that with an average crime rate of 280.36 and a standard deviation of 69.26, the probability of finding a council with a crime rate higher than 400 was 4.2%.\nBefore moving on, I need to note that z can be negative. If we were assessing the probability of finding a council with a crime rate of less than 160.5 (280.36 - 1.73*69.26) we would get a z-score of -1.73. Because the Normal Distribution is symmetrical, we can use the same process, but need to reverse the logic. Because the right tail probability gives us the area to the right of the z-score, a negative z-score would give us the area to the left of the z-score. So, the probability of finding a council with a crime rate of less than 160.5 is also 4.2%.",

    "text": "What are Degrees of Freedom?\nWhen we calculate the population standard deviation \\(σ\\), we are referring to a fixed parameter that describes how all values in the population vary around the population mean \\(μ\\). In theory, if we had access to every value in the population, we could calculate \\(σ\\) exactly, because no uncertainty is involved — we would be using the entire population, not a subset of it. This is a true calculation rather than an estimation: we are determining \\(σ\\) directly from all \\(N\\) population values, using the actual population mean \\(μ\\), which is fixed and known.\nWhen we replace \\(σ\\) with \\(s\\) in the formula for the standard error of the mean,\n\\[\\sigma_{\\bar{y}} = \\frac{σ}{\\sqrt{n}} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad se = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}},\\]\nwe introduce uncertainty because \\(s\\) depends on the sample data. In a sample, the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) is not a fixed, known quantity (as \\(μ\\) is in the population) but is calculated from the same data. That means it depends on \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\). Once we calculate \\(\\bar{x}\\), it creates a built-in relationship among the observations (see below for proof):\n\\[\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0.\\]\nNow suppose we have 5 observations: \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\). If we have calculated the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\), as well as the deviations for the first four observations \\((x_1 - \\bar{x}), (x_2 - \\bar{x}), (x_3 - \\bar{x}), (x_4 - \\bar{x})\\), then the deviation for the fifth observation \\((x_5 - \\bar{x})\\) is determined automatically because all deviations must sum to zero. Thus, only 4 of the 5 deviations are free to vary independently — we lose one degree of freedom because we had to estimate \\(\\bar{x}\\) from the data.\nIn contrast, in the population, each \\(x_i\\) can vary independently; there’s no constraint linking them because \\(μ\\) isn’t estimated from them. Such a constraint exists only in a sample, due to the requirement that \\(\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\\).\n\nProof that \\(\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\\)\n\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})\n&=\\sum x_i-\\sum \\bar{x} \\\\[2ex]\n&=\\sum x_i - n\\bar{x} \\\\[2ex]\n&=\\sum x_i - n\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum x_i\\right) \\\\[2ex]\n&=\\sum x_i - \\sum x_i \\\\[2ex]\n&=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\nq.e.d.",

We know \\(\\sigma\\)\nIf the population distribution is known and the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is available, we can construct a confidence interval using the standard normal distribution (z-distribution).\nAssume we have a sample of student ages with sample size \\(n = 81\\) and a sample mean \\(\\bar{y} = 26\\). The population standard deviation is known to be \\(\\sigma = 9\\). We aim to construct a 99% confidence interval for the true population mean age of students. (In the lecture, we considered the 95% confidence level for this same scenario.)\nWe begin by calculating the standard error of the sample mean:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\sigma_{\\bar{y}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\sigma_{\\bar{y}} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{81}} = 1\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nWhat is important to bear in mind for the construction of confidence intervals, is that we do not just need the right-tail probability, because the area we are trying to cover under the distribution is symmetrical around the mean. This is visualised in Figure 1 where the area is defined between \\(\\pm\\) 1.96 standard deviations around the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: 95 Percent Confidence Interval around the Mean\n\n\n\nAs the orange area needs to be 95%, the remaing areas to the left and right need to be equal to 5% jointly. So each of them is 2.5%. When we look into our Table with right-tail probabilities, we therefore need to look for the z-score that corresponds to 0.025 (or 2.5%). When you look in the Normal Table (see Statistical Tables), then you will find this at z=1.96.\nNow, the question arises, how many standard deviations we need for a 99% confidence interval. The area to the left and right needs to be jointly 1%, or 0.05% each side. We consult the Normal Table again, and try to find the z-score for 0.005. The exact value is not available, only either 0.0051, or 0.0049. 0.0051 would lead to a confidence interval of 98.98%, so not quite large enough. We therefore need to go for 0.0049, and the corresponding z-score of z=2.58.\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\ny = \\bar{y} \\pm 2.58 \\times \\sigma_{\\bar{Y}}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nPopping the values in we receive\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n26 \\pm 2.58 \\times 1\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nAs a result, we can say that we are 99% confident that the true average age of students at Warwick lies between 23.42 and 28.58. Note that this confidence interval is wider than the 95% one where the boundaries were defined as 24.04 and 27.96. As we went for higher certainty here, the confidence interval became wider. If we want our interval to contain the true average in 99 out of 100 samples, we need to cast our net wider than if we were content with 95.",

    "text": "2. We don’t know \\(\\sigma\\)\nIf we don’t know the population distribution and its standard deviation, we need to use the t-distribution. As you know from the lecture, the t-distribution is a shape shifter. Its width depends on the degrees of freedom: the more degrees of freedom we have, the more narrow, or the closer to the normal distribution it comes. With df=30 the shapes of the t-distribution and the normal distribution are almost identical. You can see this in the following Figure, comparing the yellow t-distribution for \\(df=30\\) and the black (normal) distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of t-Distributions\n\n\n\nIn reversed logic, this also means that the t-distribution is rather wide for small sample sizes (and small df). Consequently, a confidence interval of a given level (e.g. 99%) would be much wider for a small sample size than under the normal distribution (or t-distributions with higher sample sizes). Let me illustrate this using the same sample average as for the normal distribution example above, \\(\\bar{y}=26\\). We have a sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)) of 2. Our sample size is very small, we only have \\(n=4\\). Again, we want an interval within which we find with 99% confidence the true average age of students.\nWe start by estimating the standard error:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    se=\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\nse=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4}}=1\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThis time we have to search in the t-Table, taking into account the degrees of freedom. As \\(n=4\\), this means that \\(df=3\\). Conveniently, the Table lists at the top the desired confidence interval. For \\(df=3\\) and a 99% confidence interval, the corresponding t-value is 5.841. Once again, we calculate:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\bar{y} \\pm 5.841 \\times se\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nand\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n26 \\pm 5.841 \\times 1\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThe resulting boundaries are 20.159 as the lower boundary, and 31.841 as the upper boundary. This is far wider than the 99% confidence interval we obtained for the normal distribution, where the lower and upper boundaries were 23.42 and 28.58, respectively. This is a reflection of the fact that we only had a very small sample (\\(n=4\\)) to base our inference on and therefore have a lot of uncertainty in our inference.\nTo conclude, it is fair to say that the procedure is essentially the same as with the normal procedure, only that have to go the extra step of taking into account the degrees of freedom.\nYou are now ready to do some exercises.",

    "text": "Considerations for Interpreting Significance Tests\n\nInterpreting Significance Tests\nIn these exercises, and when reporting statistical results more generally, you’ll be required to interpret the outcome of a significance test. To do this well, it’s important to use language that reflects what null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) actually tells us, without overstating what the test can conclude.\nNHST works by starting with the null hypothesis - usually a claim like “there is no effect” or “there is no difference”. We use the data to test whether that assumption is plausible. If the p-value is small, it means that results as extreme as the one we observed — or more extreme — would be rare if the null hypothesis were true. So, we take that as evidence against the null. But if the p-value is large, then the data are consistent with the null. And that’s where your interpretation should stop (at least at the introductory level, to avoid stretching and overstating).\nThere are two possible outcomes of a significance test: (1) your p-value is below the required significance level, and (2) your p-value is above the required significance level. Let’s look at these in turn:\n\nIf your p-value is below the required significance level, you can say things like:\n\n“There is evidence of an effect.”\n“We reject the null hypothesis.”\n“The data provide evidence against the null hypothesis.”\n“There is statistically significant evidence of a difference (or relationship, or effect).”\n\n\nAvoid phrasing that implies certainty, such as:\n\n🚫 “We proved the alternative hypothesis.”\n🚫 “We proved that there is an effect.”\n🚫 “We accept the alternative hypothesis.”\n\n\n\n\nIf your p-value is above the required significance level to reject the null hypothesis, you can say things like:\n\n“There is insufficient evidence for an effect (of a difference, for a relationship).”\n“We cannot reject the null hypothesis.”\n“We fail to reject the null hypothesis.”\n“The results are consistent with the null hypothesis.”\n\n\nAvoid phrasing that overstates what the test can tell you, such as:\n\n🚫 “We proved the null hypothesis.”\n🚫 “We reject the alternative hypothesis.”\n🚫 “The null hypothesis is true.”\n\n\n\nHaving taught quantitative political analysis for many years, I know that students love to use the word “prove” when they interpret their results. But there is no proof in significance testing, because we deal with probability statements, not certainty.",

    "section": "Measuring Effect Size",
    "text": "Measuring Effect Size\nIn significance testing, we have been concerned with the distance between an observed value, for example \\(\\bar y\\), and a null-hypothesis value \\(\\mu_0\\). Now, suppose we have a sample of students who have scored an average mark of 42 in an exam (\\(\\bar y=40\\)). If the pass mark of the exam was 40 (\\(\\mu_0=40\\)), then, on average, these students have done better by a difference of 2 marks. This raw difference might seem informative at first glance, but it will be hard to compare it across different contexts. Why? Imagine we look at exam marks in two different modules. The marks of students on module A are closely clustered together, most within about 5 points of the average. In this setting, a 2-point increase is fairly big compared to the usual spread. In module B, meanwhile, students’ marks vary a lot, often 20 points above or below the average. In this setting, the same 2-point increase is tiny compared to the usual spread.\nThis is why we cannot stop at raw differences – we need to find a way to standardise the difference so that we can compare across different contexts. And this is precisely what a measure called “Cohen’s \\(d\\)” does. It is defined as\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\bar x - \\mu_0}{\\text{s}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_0\\) is the null hypothesis value. This formula standardises the raw distance by dividing it by the standard deviation (s) of marks.\nTo continue with our example, if the sample standard deviation of exam marks is 10 points, then:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{42 - 40}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.20\n\\]\nSo our observed effect is \\(d = 0.20\\). How do we interpret this result? Cohen (2013) suggested some rough rules of thumb for interpreting \\(d\\):\n\nInterpretation\n\n\\(d \\approx 0.2 \\Rightarrow\\) small effect (a subtle shift, often hard to detect)\n\n\\(d \\approx 0.5 \\Rightarrow\\) medium effect (a clear, noticeable shift)\n\\(d \\approx 0.8 \\Rightarrow\\) large effect (a big, obvious shift)\n\nNote that these are rough guidelines, only. The onus is on you as a researcher to judge what is required/acceptable in the context of your project.\n\nA value of \\(d = 0.20\\) in our example means the average mark is 0.2 standard deviations above the null value. That is considered a small effect: the group did a little better than the pass mark, but the difference is modest relative to the variability in marks.\nIn summary, Cohen’s \\(d\\) encourages us to think not just about whether an effect exists, but whether it is meaningfully large. We are now going to use it to determine the statistical power of a one-sample significance test. You will see that smaller \\(d\\) values need larger sample sizes to be detected reliably.",

    "title": "Week 5",
    "section": "What is statistical power?",
    "text": "What is statistical power?\nStatistical power is the probability that a study will detect an effect if the effect really exists. Formally, we can write this as:\n\\[\n\\text{Power} = P(\\text{reject } H_0 \\mid \\text{effect exists})\n\\]\nIf a test has high statistical power, we are likely to detect a real effect. A test with low statistical power, meanwhile, would likely miss an effect, even if it really existed. A commonly applied threshold for statistical power is 80% (see Lakens (2013) and Button et al. (2013)). To understand what this probability is, you need to imagine that we are doing the same study (same sample size, etc.) an infinite number of times. Then, if the true effect in the population (\\(d_{true}\\)) is as large as the effect we planned to detect (\\(d_{test}\\)), we would detect this effect in 80% of these repeated studies. Let me illustrate this with an example:\nImagine we are testing whether the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in exam preparation increases exam performance. Without the use of AI the average mark for a model is 70. We plan our study to detect a difference of 5 marks – that is, we want to know whether students using AI achieve an average of 75 marks instead of 70. With a standard deviation of 10 marks the 5-point difference corresponds to a Cohen’s d of 0.5 (\\(5 / 10 = 0.5\\)). So, our target effect size is \\(d_{test} = 0.5\\).\nSuppose we collect data from 64 students and conduct a test of statistical significance with an \\(\\alpha\\) value of 5%. A setup with this sample size would achieve 80% power in detecting a true difference of 5 marks – or equivalently, a true effect of \\(d_{true} = 0.5\\).\nThis means:\n\nIf the use of AI really improves marks by 5 points on average in the population (\\(d_{true} = 0.5\\)),\nand if we repeated this same study many times,\nthen in about 80% of those studies we would find a statistically significant difference (correctly rejecting \\(H_0\\)).\nIn the remaining 20%, we would miss it due to random variation – we’d fail to detect the effect even though it exists (a make a Type II error).\n\n\nSo, how do you set \\(d_{\\text{test}}\\)?\nSince the true effect size \\(d_{\\text{true}}\\) is unknown, we plan a study by working with an assumed effect size. This assumed value can come from:\n\nPrevious studies: using their reported \\(d_{\\text{obs}}\\) as a rough guide\nTheoretical expectations: deciding what size of effect would be meaningful in the context of your study (sometimes called the “smallest effect size of interest”).\n\nCohen’s original conventions\n\nOnce we pick an assumed effect size, we can calculate how large our sample \\(n\\) needs to be for the conventional 80% power. If the true effect size \\(d_{\\text{true}}\\) really is at least that big, then our study will have the planned power.\n\nBecause statistical power measures the probability of detecting a real effect, anything that makes the effect stand out more clearly from random noise will increase power. The two factors that are primarily responsible for this are the size of the true effect itself, and the sample size. Larger effects are simply easier to detect and so power will increase with larger true effects. In terms of sample size, larger samples are better at smoothing out random variation, and thus enable us to estimate the true effect more accurately.\nLet’s return to our earlier example of exam marks to illustrate this. Here, we were testing whether the average exam mark was higher than the pass mark of 40. Imagine that, in the population, the true average is 42 and the population standard deviation is equal to 10. This means the true effect size is\n\\[\nd_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{42 - 40}{10} = 0.2.\n\\]\nIf we take a sample of 25 students, our study might have only around 40% power. In other words: even though the true mean really is 2 points above 40 (so \\(d_{\\text{true}} = 0.2\\)), our test would only reject \\(H_0\\) in about 4 out of 10 repeated studies. If instead we sampled 100 students, the power would increase to about 80%. That means in the long run we would correctly detect this true 2-point effect about 8 times out of 10.\nIn any particular sample, we could calculate an observed effect size \\(d_{\\text{obs}}\\) (using the sample mean and standard deviation). Sometimes \\(d_{\\text{obs}}\\) will be close to 0.2, sometimes higher, sometimes lower — but the power calculation is always based on the underlying \\(d_{\\text{true}}\\).\nBut how do we get from \\(d\\) to power? The link is through the \\(t\\)-statistic. When you read the formula and description for Cohen’s \\(d\\) earlier, you might have had a déjà vu, because the \\(t\\)-score is defined as\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\text{se}}, \\qquad \\text{where se} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}.\n\\]\nThis means that \\(t\\) and \\(d\\) are very closely related, namely through this little exercise in algebra3:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nt &\\;=\\; \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_0}{\\,s/\\sqrt{n}\\,} = \\frac{(\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)\\cdot(1/s)}{(s/\\sqrt{n})\\cdot(1/s)} \\;= \\\\ \\\\\n  &\\;=\\; \\frac{(\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)/s}{(s/\\sqrt{n})/s} \\;=\\; \\frac{(\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)/s}{\\,1/\\sqrt{n}\\,} \\;= \\\\ \\\\\n  &\\;=\\; \\left( \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_0}{s} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{1}  \\;=\\; \\left( \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_0}{s} \\right) \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\;= \\\\ \\\\\n  &\\;=\\; d\\cdot \\sqrt{n}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhat this shows is that the t-statistic is just Cohen’s d scaled by sample size. So, for a fixed effect size \\(d\\), increasing \\(n\\) makes \\(t\\) larger, which makes it more likely to cross the critical threshold in a test of statistical significance. Or to put it differently, it increases the probability of detecting an effect that truly exists - statistical power.\nThe calculation of power itself is slightly beyond the scope of an introductory level module, because we need a different distribution, a noncentral \\(t\\) distribution to be precise, for this purpose. Instead, I have designed an app which calculates this automatically for you (see below). What might be interesting to know in the context of the lecture, however, is that power is equal to \\(1-\\beta\\) where \\(\\beta\\) is the Type II Error. Let’s conclude this section with the following statements:\n\n\nFor a small effect (\\(d = 0.20\\)), increasing \\(n\\) pushes \\(t\\) upward by \\(\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\nWith small \\(n\\), sampling noise keeps \\(t\\) below the cut-off most of the time (low power).\n\nWith larger \\(n\\), the standard error shrinks, \\(t\\) grows, and power increases.\n\nIn terms of the exam example, you could use this information for planning a survey: if you care about detecting a small but meaningful 2-point difference, you generally need larger samples than 25 – often well above 100 – to achieve comfortable power (for example, around 80%).\n\n\n\nAn Application\nTo illustrate how this works in practice, I have written an application that lets you evaluate a completed one-sample t-test and plan a replication. You enter the results you observed in that test, and the app shows the statistical power at your observed \\(n\\) (two-sided, at your chosen \\(\\alpha\\)). As a special feature, you can switch to the “smallest effect size of interest” (SESOI), which lets you plan the \\(n\\) required for a meaningful effect.\n\n  Open Application      \n\n\nHere is how to use it:\n\nEnter the observed t-statistic and the observed sample size \\(n\\).\nChoose \\(\\alpha\\) (significance level).\nInterpret the statistical power of your test.\nOptional: turn on SESOI and pick a Cohen’s \\(d\\) (Small \\(\\approx 0.2\\), Medium \\(\\approx 0.5\\), Large \\(\\approx 0.8\\)).\n\nSESOI tells the app that only effects at least this big are meaningful.\n\nIf SESOI is off, the app uses the observed effect \\(\\hat d = t/\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\nIf SESOI is on, the app fixes the curve at your chosen \\(d\\) and, for convenience, shows the required \\(n\\) for 80% power as an orange dotted line.\n\n\nIn order to choose \\(d\\) appropriately, pick a minimum meaningful change in real units and divide by a typical standard deviation. For example, if you think that a difference of 2 exam points from an assumed null value (such as the fail mark of 40) matters and the SD is about 10, then \\(d \\approx 2/10 = 0.2\\) (small).\n\n\n\nHow the “Power vs n” curve is calculated\n\nWhen you choose a fixed standardized effect size \\(d\\) (either your observed \\(\\hat d = \\tfrac{t}{\\sqrt{n_{\\text{obs}}}}\\) or a SESOI), the curve shows the power of a two-sided one-sample \\(t\\)-test across many candidate sample sizes \\(n\\).\nFor each \\(n\\):\n\nDegrees of freedom: \\(\\mathrm{df} = n - 1\\)\n\nNoncentrality parameter: \\(\\delta = d\\sqrt{n}\\)\n\nCritical cut-off (two-sided, level \\(\\alpha\\)): \\(t_{\\alpha/2,\\,\\mathrm{df}}\\)\n\nUnder a true effect \\(d\\), the test statistic follows a noncentral \\(t\\) distribution:\n\\[\nT \\sim t_{\\mathrm{df}}(\\text{ncp} = \\delta)\n\\]\nThe power is the probability that \\(|T|\\) exceeds the critical cut-off:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{power}(n)\n= \\Pr\\!\\left(|T|\\ge t_{\\alpha/2,\\ \\mathrm{df}} \\,\\middle|\\, \\delta\\right)\n= \\big[1 - F_{\\text{nct}}(t_{\\alpha/2,\\ \\mathrm{df}};\\ \\mathrm{df},\\ \\delta)\\big]\n+ F_{\\text{nct}}(-t_{\\alpha/2,\\ \\mathrm{df}};\\ \\mathrm{df},\\ \\delta)\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{\\text{nct}}\\) is the CDF of the noncentral \\(t\\) distribution.\nWhat the curve means\n\nSESOI off: The curve treats the observed \\(\\hat d = t_{\\text{obs}}/\\sqrt{n_{\\text{obs}}}\\) as the “true” effect and shows how power would change if you repeated the study with different \\(n\\).\n\nSESOI on: The curve instead uses your chosen meaningful effect size \\(d\\). In this mode, the app also shows the required \\(n\\) to reach 80% power with an orange marker.\n\nReproducing the curve in R\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Power of a two-sided one-sample t-test via the noncentral t distribution\npower_one_sample &lt;- function(d, n, alpha = 0.05) {\n  df    &lt;- n - 1\n  tcrit &lt;- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = df)\n  delta &lt;- d * sqrt(n)\n  p_upper &lt;- 1 - pt(tcrit, df = df, ncp = delta)\n  p_lower &lt;-     pt(-tcrit, df = df, ncp = delta)\n  p_upper + p_lower\n}\n\n# Example settings\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\nd_use &lt;- 0.50          # e.g., \"medium\" SESOI; or d_use &lt;- tobs/sqrt(nobs)\nn_seq &lt;- 5:200\n\n# Compute the curve\npower_vals &lt;- sapply(n_seq, power_one_sample, d = d_use, alpha = alpha)\ndf_curve   &lt;- data.frame(n = n_seq, power = power_vals)\n\n# Optional: check against power.t.test at a single n\nn_check &lt;- 30\np1 &lt;- power_one_sample(d = d_use, n = n_check, alpha = alpha)\np2 &lt;- stats::power.t.test(\n  n = n_check, delta = d_use, sd = 1,\n  sig.level = alpha, type = \"one.sample\", alternative = \"two.sided\"\n)$power\nsprintf(\"Check at n=%d: custom=%.4f, power.t.test=%.4f\", n_check, p1, p2)\n\n[1] \"Check at n=30: custom=0.7540, power.t.test=0.7540\"\n\n# Plot the curve\nggplot(df_curve, aes(n, power)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.80, linetype = 2) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = sprintf(\"Power vs n (one-sample t-test; d = %.2f, alpha = %.2f)\", d_use, alpha),\n    x = \"Sample size n\",\n    y = \"Power\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy sd = 1 in the check? Because Cohen’s \\(d\\) is already standardized (\\(d = \\Delta/\\sigma\\)). The function power.t.test expects the unstandardized difference \\(\\Delta\\) and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Setting sd = 1 and delta = d makes the inputs consistent with a standardized effect size.\n\n\n\nHow to read the Power vs \\(n\\) plot\n\nAxes and lines\n\nX-axis: sample size \\(n\\) (one-sample test).\nY-axis: power (0 to 1).\nSolid curve: analytical power for the current effect and \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nWith SESOI off: uses \\(\\hat d = t/\\sqrt{n_{\\text{obs}}}\\).\nWith SESOI on: uses your chosen \\(d\\) (SESOI).\n\nDashed horizontal line at 0.80: a common 80% power target.\nDotted vertical line (grey): your observed \\(n\\); the dot shows power at that \\(n\\).\nDotted vertical line (orange): shown only when SESOI is on; marks the smallest \\(n\\) that reaches 0.80 power (labelled as \\(n \\approx \\dots\\) @ 80% power).\n\nFinding the sample size you need\n\nWith SESOI on, read the orange line and label to get the sample size to plan for 80% power at your chosen \\(\\alpha\\).\nIf the curve never hits 0.80 within the plot range, you would need a larger \\(n\\), a larger meaningful effect (bigger \\(|d|\\)), a one-sided test (only if justified), or a larger \\(\\alpha\\) (with caution).\n\nHow the controls shift the curve\n\nLarger \\(|d|\\) moves the curve up and left (fewer \\(n\\) needed).\nIncreasing \\(\\alpha\\) (for example, 0.10 vs 0.05) moves the curve up; decreasing \\(\\alpha\\) moves it down.\nChanging the observed \\(t\\) or \\(n\\) with SESOI off updates \\(\\hat d\\) and thus the curve. With SESOI on, the curve stays fixed by your chosen \\(d\\); changing \\(n\\) only moves the dot.\n\nShape and diminishing returns\n\nThe curve is steepest at small \\(n\\) and flattens as power approaches 1.\nBecause \\(t = d\\sqrt{n}\\), halving \\(|d|\\) typically requires about four times the \\(n\\) to maintain similar power.\n\nInterpreting the dot and the lines\n\nThe dot is your current power at the observed \\(n\\).\nIf the dot is below 0.80, you likely need a bigger \\(n\\) (or a larger \\(d\\) of interest, higher \\(\\alpha\\), or a justified one-sided test).\n\nRemember\n\nPower is the probability to reject the null-hypothesis given that an effect exists, or formally \\(P(\\text{reject } H_0 \\mid \\text{effect exists})\\). It is not a \\(p\\)-value (see below) and not the probability that \\(H_0\\) is true.\nYou can pair power planning with a SESOI: decide what \\(d\\) would be meaningful in your context and size your study to detect it.\n\n\n\nWhat this means in practice:\n\nThat a result is statistically significant does not mean that it is practically important. With very large \\(n\\), even tiny effects can be significant.\n\nEqually, insignificant results do no mean “no true effect”. With small \\(n\\), a real effect can be missed because power is low.",

How do base rates (margins) influence the test, even when the row-percentage gap is similar?\n\nExploring Fisher’s exact test\n\nBuild some very small tables (with low cell counts). Try cases where at least one expected count is less than \\(5\\), and cases where all expected counts are above \\(5\\). Watch for when the app switches from showing a \\(\\chi^2\\) p-value to also showing a Fisher p-value.\nCompare the \\(\\chi^2\\) and Fisher results in these tiny-\\(N\\) situations. Do they always agree? When do they differ most?\nBased on your experiments, summarize in your own words:\n\nWhat condition seems to trigger Fisher’s test to appear?\nWhy might researchers prefer Fisher’s exact test in those situations?\nIn larger samples, why is \\(\\chi^2\\) usually preferred instead?",

    "text": "Correlation\nI have written yet another app! Once it loads (it will take a little time, it’s a beast), it lets you generate and explore bivariate relationships and see how Pearson’s r responds to different shapes, amounts of noise, and sample sizes. You can overlay a straight-line fit (the regression line we will explore next week) and a smooth non-linear fit (LOESS) to compare them. The current Pearson r is shown as a label on the plot.\nPlease note that in the explanations below I will refer to some relationships as “monotonic”, so here is a brief definition:\n\nMonotonic means “always moving in one direction”.\nA relationship is monotonic if, as x increases, y never reverses direction: it either never decreases (monotone increasing) or never increases (monotone decreasing). The rate can change and the curve can be curved or flat in places – it just must not switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa).\n\nBy the way, in the lecture we have focused on continuous data and this is preset in the app. But from the reading you (hopefully) know that other correlation coefficients exist for categorical data. You can explore an example for binary variables in the app, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\nUnder Data type, choose Continuous (scatter).\nPick a Relationship pattern:\n\nLinear (bivariate normal): straight-line trend with a controllable target r.\nQuadratic: U-shaped, clearly non-linear and non-monotonic.\nCubic: monotonic but curved, a single overall direction with curvature.\n\nAdjust Sample size (n) and either Target Pearson r (for Linear) or Noise (for Quadratic and Cubic).\nToggle the line of best fit (regression line) and LOESS smooth to compare linear versus non-linear fits.\nUse Seed to regenerate the sample while keeping settings the same.\nRead the Pearson r label on the plot.\n\nControls at a glance\n\nRelationship pattern\n\nLinear (bivariate normal): set Target Pearson r.\nQuadratic and Cubic: set Noise to make the pattern tighter or looser.\n\nn (Sample size): larger n stabilizes estimates.\nSeed: changes the random draw while keeping other settings fixed.\nShow least-squares line: straight-line fit.\nShow smooth (LOESS): flexible curve that can reveal non-linear structure.\n\nTips for interpretation\n\nPearson’s r captures linear association.\nQuadratic is not monotonic, so r can be near zero even when a strong U-shape is visible.\nCubic is monotonic but curved; r can be pulled down by curvature even when a strong relationship exists.\nLOESS helps reveal curvature and local structure that a straight line can miss.\nIncreasing n reduces sampling variability; increasing Noise weakens visible structure.\n\n\n\nExercises\nI. Linear relationships\n\nSet Linear, Target r = 0.60, n = 50. Record the Pearson r on the plot. Now set n = 300. How does r change, and what does this show about sample size?\nWith Linear, try r = 0.20, n = 60. Change Seed several times. How much does r bounce around, and why?\n\nII. Non-linear and non-monotonic (Quadratic)\n\nChoose Quadratic, set Noise = 0.10, n = 200. Is r near zero despite a clear U-shape? Explain why.\nIncrease Noise until the U-shape is hard to see. At what point do the linear and LOESS fits become similarly uninformative?\n\nIII. Non-linear but monotonic (Cubic)\n\nChoose Cubic, set Noise = 0.15, n = 200. Compare the linear line to the LOESS curve. Does the straight line understate the visible relationship?\nIncrease Noise gradually. How quickly does r decline as the pattern gets noisier? What does the LOESS curve reveal as noise grows?\n\nIV. Comparing fits (lines)\n\nFor Cubic with moderate Noise, toggle Least-squares line on and off and compare to LOESS. How does the straight line mislead about strength or direction?\nIn Linear mode, when do the LOESS and linear fits essentially coincide, and why should they?\n\nV. Sampling variability and reproducibility\n\nFix a setting, for example Linear r = 0.40, n = 80, and change Seed a few times. How much does r vary? Repeat with n = 400 and compare.\nFor Cubic with low Noise, change Seed repeatedly. How stable is r across seeds?\n\nVI. Same r, different story\n\nFind two scenarios with similar Pearson r but different shapes (for example, Linear versus Cubic with noise tuned). How do the plots and the LOESS curve help you tell them apart?\n\nVII. Reflections\n\nWhen is Pearson’s r an adequate summary, and when would you favor a non-linear description?\nBased on what you see in the app, how would you justify using a non-linear model rather than a linear one?\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nPearson r summarizes linear, directional association.\n\nNonlinear, non-monotonic relationships (e.g., U-shapes) can be strong yet have r ≈ 0. Always plot your data.",

    "text": "Exporting the Results\nAs for the graphs, you can also export and save the results of the regression model in a Word table. To do that you can use the ‘modelsummary’ package.\nJust like writing a shopping list, we start by creating a list of models for which we want modelsummary to produce a table. You can merely list the names of the objects in which the models are stored, or you can give them specific names which will appear as column titles in the table. This addition is by no means a must, but sometimes you might wish to give models a particular name, for example if you have used different methods of estimation, different components of a theory, etc. In the table we are creating here, I wish to distinguish between bivariate and multivariate models. By default, modelsummary just numbers models in ascending order.\n\nmodels &lt;- list(\n  \"Bivariate\"    = model\n)\n\nThis simple step is already sufficient to produce – an admittedly somewhat crude – results table. All we have to do is to load the modelsummary package and to use the previously defined list of models as the argument of the modelsummary() function:\n\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nmodelsummary(models)\n\n\nExecute these code chunks as we go through this Section, so you can see the alterations we make to the table in real-time.\n\nThis table is a vast improvement on the raw R output you would receive when calling summary(model1). But it is far from finished. One characteristic which is conspicuously absent is an assessment of statistical significance. In model summaries of this kind this information is usually provided in the form of asterisks or other symbols next to the respective coefficient. We can add these simply by adding the option stars=TRUE to the code.\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE)\n\nNext up is the modification of the stub. The stub is the leftmost column in which you name the indicators for which coefficients will be presented.In the stub, “[a]bbreviate nothing. And never ever ever use computer variable names to stand for concepts. These are personal code words that convey no meaning to readers.” (Stimson, n.d., p. 10) Following this advice, let us add proper labels to the independent variables.\nTo let modelsummary know how to replace each variable name, we create a so-called coefficient map. This is really just a character vector which follows a “before-after” logic in each of its rows. For example 'age'='Age' replaces the variable name age with the label Age. We need to do this for all the variables we used in our models. I am storing this in a vecor called cm which stands for coefficient map.\n\ncm &lt;- c('idaci'    = 'Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index',\n        '(Intercept)' = 'Intercept')\n\nThe next step is easy, as we only need to feed this coefficient map into the modelsummary code with the option coef_map=cm:\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm)\n\nThis is a personal thing, but I also like to show the label of the dependent variable in results tables. They just feel incomplete to me without this information. There is no default to achieve this in modelsummary and so we need to use a little trick.\nWhat I want to add in the first row, but only in the second columm, the text . This requires us to alter the style of the table slightly. modelsummary uses another package called tinytable to style the output. We load the package with library(tinytable) and instruct R to place the text where we want it.\n\nlibrary(tinytable)\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm)|&gt;\n  group_tt(j = list(\"Dependent Variable: GCSE Score\" = 2))\n\nLastly, let us tackle the model fit statistics. By default, modelsummary prints a whole festival of these into the bottom section of the table, but I want to concentrate only on R\\(^2\\).\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm,\n             gof_omit = 'DF|Deviance|Log.Lik|F|AIC|BIC|RMSE')|&gt;\n  group_tt(j = list(\"Dependent Variable: GCSE Score\" = 2))\n\nThis should produce Table 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n\n \nDependent Variable:GCSE Score\n\n              \n                 \n                Bivariate\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01\n        \n                \n                  Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index\n                  0.020***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.003)\n                \n                \n                  Intercept\n                  45.853***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.657)\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Regression Models\n\n\n\n\nYou can export your tables for use in MS Word, or Apple Pages.

Again, more formally, we can state that \\(\\mu \\ne \\mu_{0}\\)\n\n\nanalysis\nA detailed evaluation of data to discover their structure and relevant information to answer a research question\n\n\nasymmetry\nThe notion that while X causes Y, Y does not cause X. It is established with temporal priority, manipulated events, and/or the independence of causes (see Brady (2011))\n\n\nattribute\nA component or characteristic of a concept\n\n\nbackground concept\nThe broad constellation of meanings and understandings associated with the concept (Adcock & Collier, 2001, p. 531)\n\n\ncase\nUnit of analysis (rows in our dataset/table)\n\n\ncategorical\nDescribing the qualitative categories of a characteristic, for example different religions\n\n\ncausal\nIn order to establish a causal relationship, the following criteria must be met concurrently:  \n\n\ncausal loop\nY causes itself (e.g., health; happiness, wealth)\n\n\ncentral limit theorem\nIn random sampling with a large sample size – where n=30 is usually sufficient – the sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}\\) will be approximately normally distributed, irrespective of the shape of the population distribution\n\n\ncoefficient\nA coefficient is a numerical expression which is multiplied with the value of a variable\n\n\ncoefficient of determination\nIndicates the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable which is explained through the independent variable. It is defined as \\(\\frac{\\text{Explained Sum of Squares}}{\\text{Total Sum of Squares}}\\)\n\n\nconcept\nAbstract ideas which form the building blocks of theories (Clark et al., 2021, p. 150)\n\n\nconceptualisation\nFormulating a systematized concept through reasoning about the background concept, in light of the goals of research (Adcock & Collier, 2001, p. 531)\n\n\nconditional distributions\nThe number of subjects observed at all combinations of possible outcomes for the two (or more) categorical variables in the crosstabulation\n\n\nconditional expectation function\nsee Population Regression Function (PRF)\n\n\nconfidence interval\nA confidence interval is an estimated range, based on a sample, that is likely to contain the true population parameter (such as the mean). If the sampling process were repeated many times, approximately \\((1 - \\alpha) \\cdot 100\\) % of the resulting intervals would contain the true parameter. The value of \\(\\alpha\\) determines the confidence level – for example, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) corresponds to a 95% confidence level, while \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) corresponds to 99%\n\n\nconfidence level\nThe confidence level is the proportion of confidence intervals, constructed from repeated random samples of the same population using the same method, that are expected to contain the true population parameter. It is denoted by \\(1 - \\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the significance level. For example, a 95% confidence level implies that 95% of such intervals would contain the true parameter in the long run.\n\n\nconstant\nA variable which does not vary\n\n\ncontinuous\nCan assume any value within defined measurement boundaries\n\n\ncorrelation\nThe statistical dependence of two random variables which is determined by pairwise comparison of values\n\n\ncorrelation\nAssesses the statistical dependence of two random variables by a pairwise comparison of values\n\n\ncovariance\nA measure which assesses the degree to which the values of two variables (\\(X_i\\) and \\(X_j\\)) vary together. It is defined as \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})\\).\n\n\ncritical value\nThe critical value is a threshold that determines the boundary for rejecting the null hypothesis (H\\(_0\\)) in a hypothesis test. It is a point on the probability distribution of the test statistic beyond which the null hypothesis is rejected. The critical value is chosen based on the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of the test, which represents the probability of making a Type I error (i.e., rejecting a true null hypothesis)\n\n\ncross-sectional data\nLook at different units (or cross-sections) \\(i\\) at a single point in time\n\n\ncrosstabulation\nCrosstabulations, or contingency tables, display the number of subjects observed at all combinations of possible outcomes for two (or more) categorical variables in matrix format\n\n\ndata\nDerives from the Latin which means . For our purposes it is a collection of numbers (or quantities) for the purpose of analysis\n\n\ndata set\nA collection of numerical values for individual observations, separated into distinctive variables\n\n\ndegrees of freedom\nDegrees of freedom express constraints on our estimation process by specifying how many values in the calculation are free to vary\n\n\ndependent variable\nIs dependent through some statistical or stochastic process on the value of an independent variable\n\n\ndescriptive statistics\nSummarise information about the centre and variability of a variable\n\n\ndeviation\nThe deviation \\(d\\) of an observation \\(y_{i}\\) from the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the difference between them: \\(d=y_{i}-\\bar{y}\\)\n\n\ndichotomous\nCan only assume two mutually exclusive, but internally homogeneous qualitative categories\n\n\ndiscrete\nThe result of a counting process\n\n\ndistribution\nRefers to the display of the values a variable can assume, together with their respective absolute or relative frequency\n\n\ndummy variable\nDummy variables are dichotomous, categorical variables which indicate the presence or the absence of a characteristic\n\n\neffect size\nThe magnitude of the difference or relationship. Larger effects are easier to spot and usually more practically important\n\n\nerror term\nThe error term quantifies the distance between each observation and the corresponding point on the regression line. The terms are denoted as \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\)\n\n\nExplained Sum of Squares\nThe variation that can be explained by the regression\n\n\ngeneralisability\nThe ability to apply the findings made on the basis of a representative sample to the population\n\n\nhistogram\nDisplays through rectangles the frequency with which the values of a continuous variable occur in specific ranges\n\n\nhypothesis\nIn statistics, a hypothesis is a formal statement about a population parameter or relationship between variables. Hypotheses guide statistical tests to determine whether data support or refute them. The hypothesis suggesting an effect or difference is called the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is always paired with a null-hypothesis, suggesting no effect or difference\n\n\nindependent variable\nInfluences or helps us predict the level of a dependent variable. It is often treated as fixed, or “given” in statistical analysis, and is sometimes also called “explanatory variable”\n\n\ninference\nMaking predictions about the wider population or about the future\n\n\ninteraction effect\nAn interaction effect occurs when the effect of one independent variable, \\(x_1\\), on a dependent variable, \\(y\\), depends on the level of another independent variable, \\(x_2\\). In other words, the impact of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) is not constant but varies depending on the value of \\(x_2\\), indicating that the two variables jointly influence the outcome in a non-additive way\n\n\nintercept\nThe intercept is the point at which the regression line intersects the y-axis. In this book we denote it as \\(\\beta_{0}\\)\n\n\ninterpretation\nThe explanation of results to answer the research question\n\n\ninterquartile range\nThe difference between the 3\\(^{\\text{rd}}\\) and the 1\\(^{\\text{st}}\\) quartiles\n\n\nintervening variable\nAn intervening variable is a variable that explains the relationship between two other variables, such that \\(x_1\\) affects \\(x_2\\), and in turn, \\(x_2\\) affects \\(y\\). In this case, the effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) is indirect, operating through the intervening variable \\(x_2\\). This is also referred to as indirect causality\n\n\nliterature review\nAn analytical summary of the literature relating to a particular topic with the objective of identifying a gap and thus motivating a research question\n\n\nlogarithm\nLogarithm is defined as the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number. Expressed mathematically, \\(x\\) is the logarithm of \\(n\\) to the base \\(b\\) if \\(b^x = n\\), in which case \\(x = log_b n\\)\n\n\nmarginal distributions\nMarginal distributions in a crosstabulation refer to the totals for each row and column, showing the overall distribution of each variable separately, regardless of the other. They are found in the margins of the table and help summarize how each variable is distributed across all categories\n\n\nmean\nIs equal to the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations\n\n\nmeasurement\nRefers to the selection of a measure or variable\n\n\nmedian\nSeparates the lower half from the upper half of observations\n\n\nmethod\nA tool for systematic investigation\n\n\nmode\nIs the most frequently occurring value\n\n\nmodel building\nRunning a number of regression models, each testing a different combination of variables\n\n\nmonotonic\nA relationship is monotonic if, as x increases, y never reverses direction: it either never decreases (monotone increasing) or never increases (monotone decreasing). The rate can change and the curve can be curved or flat in places—it just must not switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa).\n\n\nmulticausality\nMulticausality refers to a situation in which an outcome variable \\(y\\) is influenced by multiple independent variables, such that \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\), all contribute to explaining variations in \\(y\\). In this context, no single variable fully accounts for changes in \\(y\\); instead, the outcome is the result of the combined effects of several causes. We distinguish a speacial case here in which the independent variables are interdependent\n\n\nnon-probability sampling\nIn non-probability sampling not every unit has the same probability of being sampled\n\n\nnormal distribution\nThe normal distribution is a bell-shaped probability distribution that is symmetrical around the mean. Approximately 68% of values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 96% within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations. This is known as the empirical rule.\n\n\nnull hypothesis\nThe null hypothesis, denoted as \\(H_0\\), typically asserts that there is no effect or no difference – it serves as the point of comparison in the significance test. It thus assumes that the population value is equal to a specific value that indicates no effect. More formally, we can can note this as \\(H_{0}: \\mu = \\mu_{0}\\)\n\n\nOLS\nThe method of fitting a regression line by means of minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the observations and the estimated values\n\n\noutlier\nDefined as a value larger than the third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, or the first quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range\n\n\np-value\nThe p-value indicates the probability of obtaining a result equal to, or even more extreme than the observed value in the direction of the alternative hypothesis, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Common thresholds for significance are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. The p-value is denoted as \\(p\\)\n\n\nparameter\nA parameter is the value a statistic would assume in the long run. It is also called the Expected Value\n\n\nparsimony\nRefers to the principle “as many as necessary, as few as possible”.\n\n\npartial slope coefficient\nA partial slope coefficient measures the influence of a variable in multiple regression, holding all other independent variables in the model constant\n\n\npercentile\nIn ordered data, the percentile refers to the value of a variable below which a certain proportion of observations falls\n\n\npopulation\nCollection of all cases which possess certain pre-defined characteristics\n\n\npopulation distribution\nThe probability distribution of the population\n\n\npopulation regression function\nThe Population Regression Function (PRF) describes the expected distribution of \\(y\\), given the values of the independent variable(s) \\(x\\). It is also called the conditional expectation function (CEF) and can be denoted as \\(E(y_{i} \\mid x_{i})\\)\n\n\npower\nAlso known as “sensitivity”. It is the probability that a test will detect a true effect (reject \\(H_0\\) when it is false). Power grows with larger effects and larger samples, and shrinks when you demand stronger evidence (smaller \\(\\alpha\\)) or when variability is high\n\n\nprimary data\nPrimary data are data you have collected yourself\n\n\nprobability\nRefers to how many times out of a total number of cases a particular event occurs. We can also see it as the chance of a particular event occurring\n\n\nprobability sampling\nIn probability sampling all units have the same probability of entering the sample. In addition, all possible combinations of n cases must have the same probability to be selected\n\n\nQM\nThe process of testing theoretical propositions through the analysis of numerical data in order to provide an answer to a research question\n\n\nquartile\nDivides ordered data into four equal parts and indicates the percentage of observations that falls into the respective quartile and below\n\n\nrange\nThe difference between the largest and the smallest observation\n\n\nreference category\nThe category of a dummy variable in respect to which the effect on the value of the dependent variable is displayed\n\n\nregression\nRegression analysis determines the direction and magnitude of influence of one or more independent variables on a dependent variable\n\n\nregression line\nThe regression line describes how the dependent variable is functionally related to the values of the independent variable. It it defined by the intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and the slope \\(\\beta_{1}\\)\n\n\nreliability\nRefers to the extent to which repeated measurement produces the same results\n\n\nrepresentative sample\nA sample which contains all characteristic of the population in accurate proportions\n\n\nresearch question\nA specific enquiry relating to a particular topic or subject. It forms the starting point of the research cycle\n\n\nresidual\nAn estimation of the error term. The difference between an observation \\(y_{i}\\) and the estimated value \\(\\hat{y}_{i}\\). Denoted as \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{i}\\)\n\n\nResidual Sum of Squares\nThe variation that cannot be explained by the regression\n\n\nreverse causality\nCausality runs from x to y. If y could also cause x, then we deal with reverse causality\n\n\nsample\nA sub-group of the population\n\n\nsample distribution\nThe probability distribution of a sample\n\n\nSample Regression Function\nA regression line based on a randomly drawn sample\n\n\nsampling\nThe process of selecting sampling units from the population\n\n\nsampling\nThe process of selecting sampling units from the population\n\n\nsampling distribution\nThe probability distribution of a sample statistics, such as the mean. It can be derived from repeated sampling, or by estimation\n\n\nsampling error\nThe extent to which the mean of the population and the mean of the sample differ from one another\n\n\nsampling method\nThe way the sample is created\n\n\nsecondary data\nSecondary data are data which have been collected by somebody else\n\n\nsignificance level\nThe significance level, denoted by \\(\\alpha\\), is the threshold used in hypothesis testing to determine if a result is statistically significant. It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s actually true (a Type I error). Common levels are 0.05 or 0.01, indicating 5% or 1% risk. We will cover this properly in Week 9.\n\n\nsignificance test\nA significance test is a statistical method used to determine whether observed data provide enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis. It calculates a probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the actual sample results, assuming the null hypothesis is true\n\n\nslope\nA slope is defined as rise over run, and so it tells us how many units of y we need to climb (or descend if the slope is negative) for every additional unit of the independent variable \\(x\\)\n\n\nSocial Sciences\nAre concerned with the study of society and seek to scientifically describe and explain the behaviour of actors\n\n\nspurious\nA relationship between two variables, \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\), is said to be spurious when it appears to exist in a simple analysis but disappears or weakens substantially once a third variable, \\(x_2\\), is introduced into the analysis. This suggests that the observed association between \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\) was not causal, but rather the result of a confounding influence from \\(x_2\\)\n\n\nstandard deviation\nThe standard deviation s is defined as \\[\\begin{equation*}s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{sum of squared deviations}}{\\text{sample size} -1}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(y_{i} - \\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}\\end{equation*}\\]\n\n\nstandard error\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution. It is defined as:\\[\\begin{equation*}\\sigma_{\\bar{y}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\end{equation*}\\]\n\n\nstatistical analysis\nhe descriptive and inferential elements of Statistics\n\n\nstatistical dependence\nStatistical dependence in crosstabulations refers to a situation where the distribution of one categorical variable varies across the levels of another. If the variables are dependent, knowing the value of one gives information about the other; if independent, the distribution of one remains consistent across all categories of the other\n\n\nStatistics\nStatistics is the science of collecting, organising, analysing and interpretingnumerical data to assist in making a more informed decision\n\n\nsuppressor\nA suppressor variable is a variable, \\(x_2\\), that increases the predictive validity of another variable, \\(x_1\\), on an outcome \\(y\\) by accounting for irrelevant or misleading variance in \\(x_1\\). In other words, the relationship between \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\) becomes stronger or more apparent when \\(x_2\\) is included in the analysis, even though \\(x_2\\) may have little or no direct relationship with \\(y\\)\n\n\nsymmetry\nIn the context of causation, symmetry is understood as the law-like regularity of events. There needs to be a recipe (causal mechanism) which regularly produces effects from causes (see Brady (2011))\n\n\nsystematized concept\nA specific formulation of a concept used by a given scholar or group of scholars; commonly involves an explicit definition (Adcock & Collier, 2001, p. 531)\n\n\nt-distribution\nThe t-Distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical around a mean of zero. Its shape is dependent on the degrees of freedom in the estimation process.\n\n\ntest statistic\nA test statistic is a value calculated from the sample data that is used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis (H\\(_0\\)) in a hypothesis test. It quantifies the degree to which the observed data diverges from what is expected under the null hypothesis. In a t-test, the test statistic is a t-value, which measures the distance between the sample mean and the (hypothesised) population mean, expressed in units of standard errors\n\n\ntheory\nA formal set of ideas that is intended to explain why something happens or exists (Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries, n.d.)\n\n\nType I Error\nA Type I Error occurs when a null hypothesis (H\\(_0\\)) that is actually true is incorrectly rejected. It is also known as a false positive errors, as it suggests that an effect of difference exists, when, in fact, it does not. The probability of committing a Type I Error is denoted by the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of the test, which is typically set before conducting the test (e.g. \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05). This means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the true null hypothesis\n\n\nType II Error\nA Type II Error occurs when a null hypothesis (H\\(_0\\)) that is actually false is incorrectly accepted (or not rejected). It is also known as a false negative error, as it suggests that no effect or difference exists when, in fact, there is one\n\n\nvalidity\nThe extent to which the measure (variable) you choose genuinely represents the concept in question. The word comes from the Latin word “validus” which means “strong”\n\n\nvalue\nNumerical expressions taken by variables (close ended or open ended list)\n\n\nvariable\nAn element of a conceptual component which varies. We also call these “measures”\n\n\nvariance\nIs equal to the squared standard deviation\n\n\nz-score\nThe z-score, sometimes also referred to as z-value, expresses in units of standard deviation how far an observation of interest falls away from the mean. It is defined as \\[\\begin{equation*}z = \\frac{\\text{observation} - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}=\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\end{equation*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Glossary for PO91Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdcock, R., & Collier, D.

You will likely take your exam in a room with 200-300 people, so please be patient until all exam papers have been collected. Only then will you be allowed to leave the room in silence as other students may still be sitting their exams for other modules.",

What should I do?\n\nIf your mitigating circumstances are health (including mental health) related, please get in touch with your GP and the PAIS Wellbeing and Academic Support Team straight after the exam. It is very important that you submit documentary evidence for any mitigating circumstances affecting your performance via the personal circumstances tab on Tabula. All mitigating evidence related to in-person exams should be submitted no later than five working days following the affected exam.\nMitigation cases without proper evidence, provided in a timely manner, will not be considered by the Exam Board. Further information can be found in the Wellbeing and Support Section of the PAIS MA Handbook.",
